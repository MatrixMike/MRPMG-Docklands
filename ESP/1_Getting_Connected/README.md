# Getting Connected to an ESP32

In this project we go from getting a bare ESP32 board as delivered from a supplier to having the booard up and running connected to your PC where you can create programs and load them on to your platform.
We will provide some links to support, tutorials, descriptions of the platform capabilities.

## IDE Options

You will have to choose between cloud based development environment, PC based environments or physically loaded platform based

Arduino Cloud or Local?

[Click to get Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

[Cloud requires a locally installed 'Cloud Agent'](https://cloud.arduino.cc/download-agent)

Esspressif 
[Esspressif Web IDE](https://developer.espressif.com/blog/accelerate-your-iot-development-with-the-espressif-webide/)
I have not tried this but if you wade through the video you will see that it enables you to develop with the power of the web for speed and operate locally in your desktop environment.  I can see that it would significantly speed up compiling and improve debugging

PlatformIO (PIO)
A step up in complexity from Arduino IDE that has much greater flexibility and capability.  As an extension of Visual Studio Code (VSCode), PIO offers proffesional quality and support is unmatched.
