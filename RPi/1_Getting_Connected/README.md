# Getting Connected to your RPi Zero

Your RPi has been fitted with an SD which we have preloaded with Raspberry Pi 32bit Bookworm.  It has also been set up to connect to a specific WiFi and has been enabled with RealVNC server.
You will need to connect to it via RealVNC viewer on your laptop. You can download it from [here](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/)

When you connect up through the micro USB (PWR) you will see the green LED flashing.
After a little while your RPi will stop flashing and it should be connected to the WiFi AP (Vanessa)

Open your RealVNC viewer and set up a new connection using the IP address provided with the board.
   Use IP address 192.168.0.10x (x is the pi nbr)
   Use pi as the user ID
   Use password as the p/w
   Check the remember box, hit enter

If you are successful you will see the Bookworm background image. **Well done!**
